## What is Fibre Channel?

* From a high level, replaces SCSI disk cable with a network
* Protocol stack primarily used to send SCSI commands over the SAN
   * SCSI ---> Small Computer System Interface
   * Technically you could run IP over FC, but main application is SAN
   * RFC 2625 - IP and ARP over Fibre Channel
   * Standard "T11" per InterNational Commetee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS)
   * http://www.t11.org/
   * E.g. not IEEE or IETF
   * FCoE is T11's FC-BB-5 standard
